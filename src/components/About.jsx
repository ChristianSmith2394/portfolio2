          Iâ€™m a Fullstack Developer who is passionate about the JavaScript
          ecosystem. I am most skilled and interested about Node (Express) and
          React. Growing up I've always been intrigued in technology and
          creating/building things. My passion began with building things out of
          Lego's, K'Nex, etc. My dream position is Fullstack Development that
          focuses on Javascript, Node, React and SQLite3.
